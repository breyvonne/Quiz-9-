Our last day of class is May 3rd. 
On May 4th we have Symposium so that is why we don't have class then.
We get to have a 4 day weekend before finals.
Really that Friday is a study day to prepare for exams. 
I need to pack up my dorm for the summer.
This summer I have a business analytics internship and I am very excited.
